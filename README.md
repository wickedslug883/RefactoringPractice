# RefactoringPractice
 Refactoring "sloppy" code and creating a more refined version.

## Description

This project is simply for acedemic purposes.
Refactoring this "sloppy" code helps me have a better understanding on what is considered "great" code.
Organized code grants ease for the writer(s) and reader(s).
I really got to dive into thinking simple and organizing with notes to help better my success as a coder.
